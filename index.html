        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a Indian Cricketer representing Indian Team since 2008. I am a hardworking and passionate player trying to give best to my team in whatever way possible. I beleive in the hardwork more than the luck and I do am a bit aggressive while playing on the ground but i would mention that's just the game strategy and is till the ground only.</p>
